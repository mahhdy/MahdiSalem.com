## Introduction

Iran stands at a historic juncture where today's decisions will determine the fate of future generations.

## Fundamental Principles

We believe that Iran's transition to democracy must be based on the following principles:

1. **Peaceful**: Violence is not the solution and only perpetuates the cycle of authoritarianism
2. **Inclusive**: All social groups and segments must participate in the transition process
3. **Rights-based**: The fundamental rights of all citizens must be guaranteed
4. **Transitional justice**: Mechanisms must exist to address past crimes

## Call to Action

We invite all freedom-loving Iranians to participate in constructive dialogue about Iran's future.
