## Introduction

The relationship between democracy and ethics is one of the most important questions in contemporary political philosophy. Is democracy merely a political system, or does it have deep ethical roots?

## Democracy as an Ethical Value

Democracy is not just a method of governance; it reflects fundamental ethical values such as respect for human dignity, freedom, and equality.

### Human Dignity

Every individual, by virtue of being human, possesses inherent rights that no power has the authority to revoke.

### Freedom and Responsibility

Freedom without ethical responsibility will be unstable and destructive. Sustainable democracy requires citizens who are responsible and committed to ethical values.

## Conclusion

Iran's transition to democracy requires serious reconsideration of the ethical foundations of political and social life. Without solid ethical foundations, any political system is destined to fail.
